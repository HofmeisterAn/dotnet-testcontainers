# .NET Testcontainers
.NET Testcontainers is a library to support tests with throwaway instances of Docker containers. The library is built on top of the .NET Docker remote API and provides a lightweight implementation to support your test environment in all circumstances.

Choose from existing pre-configured configurations [^1] and start containers within a second, to support and run your tests.

:warning: A lot of features are not yet implemented. I try to add as much as I can and hope you will contribute to this great project as well.

## Examples
Pulls `nginx`, creates a new container with port binding `80:80` and hits the default site.

```csharp
var containerBuilder = new TestcontainersBuilder()
  .WithImage("nginx")
  .WithName("nginx")
  .WithPortBindings(80);

using (var container = containerBuilder.Build())
{
  container.Start();
  var request = WebRequest.Create($"http://localhost:80");
}
```
