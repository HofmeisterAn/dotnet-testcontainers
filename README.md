# .NET Testcontainers
.NET Testcontainers is a library to support tests with throwaway instances of Docker containers. The library is built on top of the .NET Docker remote API and provides a lightweight implementation to support your test environment in all circumstances.

Choose from existing pre-configured configurations [^1] and start containers within a second, to support and run your tests.

## Examples
Pulls `nginx`, creates a new container with port binding `80:80` and hits the default site.

```csharp
var testcontainersBuilder = new TestcontainersBuilder()
  .WithImage("nginx")
  .WithName("nginx")
  .WithPortBinding(80);

using (var testcontainers = testcontainersBuilder.Build())
{
  testcontainers.Start();
  var request = WebRequest.Create($"http://localhost:80");
}
```

Mounts the current directory as volume into the container and runs `hostname > /tmp/hostname` on startup.

```csharp
var target = "tmp";

var file = "hostname";

var testcontainersBuilder = new TestcontainersBuilder()
  .WithImage("nginx")
  .WithName("nginx")
  .WithMount(".", $"/{target}")
  .WithCommand("/bin/bash", "-c", $"hostname > /{target}/{file}");

using (var testcontainers = testcontainersBuilder.Build())
{
  testcontainers.Start();
}
```
